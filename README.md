# Learn Backbone.js Testing

This repository contains the source code examples used in the Packt
title: [Learn Backbone.js Testing](j.mp/backbone-testing). While the
video is distributed with code samples, this will be a living, breathing
version of the code. This is where errata in the code will be documented
and fixed initially, so check here first if you run into anything while
following along with the video. I'll be updating the code in each
section as these are discovered, but I'll also document these changes in
the readme files for each section so you can find them all easily.
